KServe Adoption Plan for Platform
üìç Background
Our platform team has successfully:

Installed KServe on our Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster

Conducted initial PoC deployments of models (e.g., Triton, ONNXRuntime)

Verified basic inference traffic works (HTTP/gRPC)

Integrated with Istio ingress and TLS

Now, we aim to scale KServe usage to internal users and teams (Data Science, ML Engineering), and prepare the platform for stable, observable, secure, and automated production deployments.

üéØ Goals for Adoption Phase
‚úÖ Enable self-service model deployment for ML teams
‚úÖ Provide reliable observability for model serving
‚úÖ Implement security and governance standards
‚úÖ Provide automation and CI/CD hooks
‚úÖ Ensure platform scalability and operational readiness
‚úÖ Document and educate users on KServe usage

üöÄ Key Adoption Areas & Action Items
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Onboarding & Enablement
 Define which users/teams can deploy InferenceService objects

 Create KServe Usage Guide:

How to write an InferenceService YAML

Supported runtimes (Triton, ONNXRuntime, PyTorch, etc.)

Storage options (S3, PVC, Git, etc.)

 Provide starter templates or kustomize examples

 Run internal training workshop / demo

2Ô∏è‚É£ Observability & Monitoring
 Integrate KServe with Prometheus for:

Model latency

Model throughput

Error rates

 Integrate KServe and Istio logs with Loki/Elasticsearch

 Provide Grafana dashboards:

Per model

Per namespace

Overall cluster model traffic

 Enable distributed tracing (optional) via OpenTelemetry / Jaeger

3Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Networking
 Finalize TLS cert strategy:

Central wildcard cert or per-model cert

 Implement network policies (limit model traffic to trusted sources)

 Validate authentication/authorization:

Istio JWT or API gateway auth

Per-namespace RBAC on InferenceService

 Audit external model endpoints and public exposure

4Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Tenancy & Resource Management
 Define resource quotas per namespace or team

 Validate GPU support (if needed) and allocation policies

 Test autoscaling scenarios:

Knative autoscaling tuning

Cold start latency optimization

 Implement fair scheduling if multiple users share the same cluster

5Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD & Automation
 Provide GitOps pipeline examples to deploy InferenceService via ArgoCD or Tekton

 Enable automated canary deployment patterns

 Build model registry integration:

When a new model version is promoted, automatically deploy it via KServe

 Implement rollback and version control for InferenceService objects

6Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Features (Optional Phase)
 Explore outlier detection and drift detection integration with Alibi

 Validate explainability support (for applicable models)

 Integrate model monitoring tools (WhyLabs, EvidentlyAI, etc.)

 Evaluate multi-cluster KServe federation if needed

üìÖ Suggested Timeline
Phase	Timeline	Key Deliverables
Phase 1 - Baseline Stabilization	Month 1	TLS, Observability, Quotas, Security
Phase 2 - User Enablement	Month 2	Docs, Training, CI/CD Templates
Phase 3 - Production Readiness	Month 3	Autoscaling tuning, Monitoring, Advanced features
Phase 4 - Growth & Scale	Month 4+	Multi-tenancy tuning, Optional drift/explainer

üìö Documentation & Artifacts To Produce
KServe User Guide (internal)

Model Deployment Checklist

Grafana dashboards for model serving

CI/CD pipeline examples

Namespace onboarding guide

Platform support contact & SLAs

üö© Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
Poor observability ‚Üí hard to debug models	Invest early in logging & metrics stack
Cold start latency impacts UX	Tune Knative & test autoscaling thresholds
Lack of user knowledge leads to misuse	Provide training and clear guides
Resource contention in shared clusters	Implement quotas and policies

‚úÖ Summary
The basic KServe PoC is a great foundation.
Next, we focus on making KServe:

‚úÖ Secure
‚úÖ Observable
‚úÖ Self-service friendly
‚úÖ Integrated into CI/CD
‚úÖ Scalable for multiple users & teams
