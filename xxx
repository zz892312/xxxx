Non-ML CI/CD Debugging Questions
1. GitHub Actions: Debugging a Failing Workflow
Scenario:
Your team uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployments. A recent push to the main branch triggered the following error:

bash
Copy
Edit
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
The remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden.
Your .github/workflows/deploy.yml includes:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- name: Deploy to Production
  run: curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}" \
       -d '{}' https://deployment.example.com/api/v1/deploy
Debugging Questions:
What could cause a 403 Forbidden error when making this API request?
How would you verify that secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN is being passed correctly?
If the API recently changed authentication methods, how would you update the workflow to support it?






2. GitHub Actions Multi-Branch Pipeline Failure
Scenario:
Your team uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployments for a microservice. The workflow runs successfully on feature branches and pull requests, but fails on the develop branch with the error:

bash
Copy
Edit
Error: Unable to resolve action 'actions/setup-node@v3', repository not found.
Your .github/workflows/build.yml includes:

yaml
Copy
Edit
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
Debugging Questions:
The error suggests that GitHub Actions can't find actions/setup-node@v3. What are some possible causes for this, and how would you check?
This issue only happens on the develop branch. What branch-specific settings or permissions would you investigate?
How would you confirm whether the issue is due to GitHub Actions service downtime or a repository permission issue?
If this workflow was working previously but recently started failing, what recent changes (in GitHub Actions, the repo, or dependencies) would you check?
If the organization has a self-hosted runner, how would you determine whether the failure is due to network restrictions, cached dependencies, or incorrect runner configuration?




1. Common Development Environment Build Debugging
Scenario:
You're setting up a Python development environment for a new project, but developers report issues when running the setup.

Problem:
After running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
They get:

bash
Copy
Edit
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow==2.8.0 (from versions: 1.15.0, 2.0.0, 2.7.0)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow==2.8.0
Additionally, some users report that their virtual environment isn't activating properly:

bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
-bash: venv/bin/activate: No such file or directory
On Windows machines, they see:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate : File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
Debugging Questions:
What could be causing the TensorFlow version compatibility issue, and how would you resolve it?
The virtual environment is failing to activate. How would you troubleshoot this on Linux/macOS vs. Windows?
On Windows, PowerShell is blocking script execution. How would you fix this, and is it safe to modify execution policies?
If different developers are experiencing different issues, what steps would you take to standardize the development setup across all machines?
If a developer is running into this issue inside a Docker container, how would your debugging approach change?



2. Jenkins Multi-Branch Pipeline Failing Due to Misconfigured Agent
Scenario:
Your team maintains a multi-branch Jenkins pipeline that builds and deploys a microservice. Developers report that PR builds work fine, but the develop branch fails with:

bash
Copy
Edit
hudson.remoting.ChannelClosedException: Channel "unknown" closed.
Caused by: java.io.IOException: Unexpected termination of the channel
Debugging Questions:
This error suggests a Jenkins agent issue. How would you determine whether it's a problem with the agent itself or the network?
If this happens only on the develop branch, what configuration differences between branches would you check?
How would you confirm whether the agent is overloaded or experiencing resource exhaustion?
If you're using Kubernetes-based agents, what would you check to ensure they are being properly scheduled and assigned resources?
