# End-to-End Onboarding Workflow

## üìù Complete Process Flow

---

## Phase 1: Request Submission

### Step 1: User Creates Onboarding Request
**Actor:** Requester  
**Action:** 
- Navigate to Issues ‚Üí New Issue ‚Üí "Application Onboarding Request"
- Fill out the form:
  - Application Code (e.g., APP-001)
  - Application Name
  - Description
  - Requester Name & Email
  - Select compatibilities: ‚òëÔ∏è ADT, ‚òëÔ∏è Jupyter, ‚òëÔ∏è Airflow
  - Set priority (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Submit the issue

**Output:**
- Issue created with ID (e.g., #123)
- Labels applied: `onboarding`, `pending-approval`
- Assigned to: team-lead

**Duration:** ~2-3 minutes

---

## Phase 2: Approval Process

### Step 2: Approval Review
**Actor:** Authorized Approver (team-lead, admin1, admin2)  
**Action:**
- Review the onboarding request issue
- Verify all required information is provided
- Comment `/approve` on the issue

**System Action:**
1. Validates commenter is authorized
2. If unauthorized ‚Üí Posts error comment, stays pending
3. If authorized ‚Üí Proceeds to Step 3

**Duration:** ~5-10 minutes (manual review)

---

### Step 3: Automated Processing (Triggered by Approval)
**Actor:** GitHub Actions Workflow  
**Actions Performed:**

#### 3a. Update Main Issue
- Remove label: `pending-approval`
- Add labels: `approved`, `in-progress`
- Post comment: "‚úÖ Onboarding request approved by @approver"

#### 3b. Parse Issue Data
- Extract: App Code, App Name, Requester, Email, Priority
- Parse selected compatibilities from checkboxes

#### 3c. Create Sub-Issues (PARALLEL EXECUTION STARTS HERE)
**If ADT selected:**
- Create issue: `[APP-001] ADT Integration` (#124)
- Add labels: `sub-issue`, `compat-adt`, `high`
- Content: Task checklist, parent reference #123

**If Jupyter selected:**
- Create issue: `[APP-001] Jupyter Integration` (#125)
- Add labels: `sub-issue`, `compat-jupyter`, `high`
- Content: Task checklist, parent reference #123

**If Airflow selected:**
- Create issue: `[APP-001] Airflow Integration` (#126)
- Add labels: `sub-issue`, `compat-airflow`, `high`
- Content: Task checklist, parent reference #123

#### 3d. Update Main Issue with TODO Labels
- Add labels to #123: `todo-adt`, `todo-jupyter`, `todo-airflow`

#### 3e. Post Sub-Issue Links
Post comment on #123:
```
## üìã Sub-Issues Created
- [ ] ADT: #124
- [ ] Jupyter: #125
- [ ] Airflow: #126
```

#### 3f. Send Notifications
- Post notification comment mentioning @requester
- Log email notification (or send via email service)

**Duration:** ~30-60 seconds (automated)

---

## Phase 3: Parallel Execution of Sub-Issues

### üîÄ TASKS RUN IN PARALLEL - INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER

---

### Step 4a: ADT Integration (Parallel Track 1)
**Actor:** ADT Team

- [ ] Review ADT compatibility requirements
- [ ] Setup ADT environment
- [ ] Configure ADT integration
- [ ] Test ADT functionality
- [ ] Document ADT setup
- [ ] Validate with requester
- Close sub-issue #124

**Duration:** ~2-5 days (depending on complexity)

---

### Step 4b: Jupyter Integration (Parallel Track 2)
**Actor:** Jupyter Team  
**Actions:**
- [ ] Review Jupyter compatibility requirements
- [ ] Setup Jupyter environment
- [ ] Configure Jupyter integration
- [ ] Test Jupyter functionality
- [ ] Document Jupyter setup
- [ ] Validate with requester
- Close sub-issue #125

**Duration:** ~2-5 days (depending on complexity)

---

### Step 4c: Airflow Integration (Parallel Track 3)
**Actor:** Airflow Team  
**Actions:**
- [ ] Review Airflow compatibility requirements
- [ ] Setup Airflow environment
- [ ] Configure Airflow integration
- [ ] Test Airflow functionality
- [ ] Document Airflow setup
- [ ] Validate with requester
- Close sub-issue #126

**Duration:** ~2-5 days (depending on complexity)

---

## Phase 4: Progress Tracking (Triggered on Each Sub-Issue Close)

### Step 5a: ADT Sub-Issue Closed
**Actor:** GitHub Actions Workflow  
**Triggered by:** Close of #124  
**Actions:**
1. Extract parent issue number (#123)
2. Remove label from #123: `todo-adt`
3. Add label to #123: `completed-adt`
4. Post comment on #123: "‚úÖ ADT Integration Completed"
5. Check if all sub-issues complete ‚Üí NO (Jupyter & Airflow still open)

---

### Step 5b: Jupyter Sub-Issue Closed
**Actor:** GitHub Actions Workflow  
**Triggered by:** Close of #125  
**Actions:**
1. Extract parent issue number (#123)
2. Remove label from #123: `todo-jupyter`
3. Add label to #123: `completed-jupyter`
4. Post comment on #123: "‚úÖ Jupyter Integration Completed"
5. Check if all sub-issues complete ‚Üí NO (Airflow still open)

---

### Step 5c: Airflow Sub-Issue Closed
**Actor:** GitHub Actions Workflow  
**Triggered by:** Close of #126  
**Actions:**
1. Extract parent issue number (#123)
2. Remove label from #123: `todo-airflow`
3. Add label to #123: `completed-airflow`
4. Post comment on #123: "‚úÖ Airflow Integration Completed"
5. Check if all sub-issues complete ‚Üí YES ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 5: Completion

### Step 6: Final Processing
**Actor:** GitHub Actions Workflow  
**Triggered by:** All sub-issues closed  
**Actions:**
1. Remove label from #123: `in-progress`
2. Add label to #123: `completed`
3. Post final comment:
```
üéâ All Compatibility Integrations Completed!
‚úÖ ADT
‚úÖ Jupyter
‚úÖ Airflow

@requester Your application is ready!
```
4. Send completion notification
5. Close main issue #123

**Duration:** ~10-15 seconds (automated)

## üìä Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Parallelizable |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1. Request Submission | ~2-3 minutes | No |
| 2. Approval Process | ~5-10 minutes | No |
| 3. Automated Processing | ~30-60 seconds | No |
| 4. Sub-Issue Work | ~2-5 days | ‚úÖ **YES - ALL PARALLEL** |
| 5. Completion | ~10-15 seconds | No |

**Total Time:** ~2-5 days (all integrations work simultaneously)

---

## üéØ Key Parallelization Points

### What Runs in Parallel:
‚úÖ **All sub-issue work** (Step 4a, 4b, 4c)
- ADT team works independently
- Jupyter team works independently  
- Airflow team works independently
- **No blocking dependencies between teams**

### What Runs Sequentially:
‚ùå Request submission ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Sub-issue creation
‚ùå Each sub-issue close triggers individual update
‚ùå Final completion after last sub-issue closes

---

## üí° Optimization Tips

1. **Assign teams immediately** after sub-issues are created
2. **Teams can start work simultaneously** - no need to wait
3. **First team to finish** can close their sub-issue anytime
4. **No bottlenecks** - each team progresses at their own pace
5. **Main issue auto-closes** when all sub-issues complete

---

## üîî Notification Points

1. **On approval** ‚Üí Requester notified
2. **Sub-issues created** ‚Üí Links posted to main issue
3. **Each sub-issue closes** ‚Üí Update comment on main issue
4. **All complete** ‚Üí Final notification + issue closes
